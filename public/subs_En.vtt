00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello! I’m Ailin, a workshop instructor at Yo También!
And today we’re going to talk about the color wheel.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800
And some basic concepts to understand
how to combine colors well.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.000
The color wheel is a visual
representation of colors arranged so that 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.120
primary, secondary, and tertiary colors
are distributed in a circular scheme.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.680
This circle helps us understand
the relationships between colors.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.560
First, let’s talk about complementary colors.
These are colors that are located

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
on opposite sides of the wheel,
like blue and orange. 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000
When combined, they create a 
strong and striking contrast.
